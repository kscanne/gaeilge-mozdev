Your feedback on our translation work so far would be greatly appreciated. Some good things to look for include:
<ol>
  <li>do the strings in the installer look like reasonable translations that would be well understood?
  <li>do the labels for the primary toolbar buttons look like reasonable translations?
  <li>do the items on the menubar and the items in the menus look like reasonable translations?
  <li>do the items in the preferences/options window, primary tabs, look reasonable?
</ol>
