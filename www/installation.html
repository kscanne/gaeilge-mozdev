<h5>Installation</h5>

<h3>Firefox Platform Installers</h3>
<p>
As of version 1.0.1 Firefox is available in Irish as the default language for Windows, Linux and Mac from the Firefox <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/all.html">All Systems and Languages</a> page.
</p>
<p>To install Firefox <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/all.html">download</a> it to your PC or Mac then click on the installer file and simply follow the installation instructions given (in Irish).</p>
<p>
Your feedback on our translation work so far would be greatly appreciated. Some good things to look for include:
<ol>
  <li>do the strings in the installer look like reasonable translations that would be well understood?
  <li>do the labels for the primary toolbar buttons look like reasonable translations?
  <li>do the items on the menubar and the items in the menus look like reasonable translations?
  <li>do the items in the preferences/options window, primary tabs, look reasonable?
</ol>
</p>

Please post to the <a href="http://gaeilge.mozdev.org/list.html">mailing list</a> if you have any bug reports.

<h3>Firefox XPI Instructions</h3>
<p>
For those who wish to use the language pack installer, instead of a full build:
<ol>
    <li>First you will need to install the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">latest Firefox release</a>.
    <li>Start up Firefox after installation, and find the XPI 
	<a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-aviary1.0.1-l10n/">here</a> (latest 1.0.4 localization).
	<li>Scroll to tbe bottom of the page and select your platform, Linux, Mac or Windows.
	<li>Scroll until you find the Irish XPI file "ga-IE.xpi" and click on it to install the language pack. 
    <li>Shut down Firefox.
    <li>Restart Firefox. Shutdown again.
    <li>Open up a command prompt/shell, go to the Firefox install directory and type:<br>
    <i>firefox -UILocale ga-IE</i><br>
    Then hit [ENTER].
</ol>
<br>
Step 6 may not be needed.
If you are uncomfortable with using the command prompt you can install the Locale switcher extension...
</p>

<h3>Locale-Switcher Extension</h3>
<p>
The Locale switcher extension makes changing languages easier by listing your installed languages under your Tools menu.  Good for folks working with the XPI version and still need English to fall back on.

<!-- Everything from here down I extracted from pages linking the XPI's 
for other languages on mozdev.org.  The plain link above
to the xpi file is all that was given in the original
installation.html template.  The (working) link below that I
had on borel is at the bottom of this page-->
