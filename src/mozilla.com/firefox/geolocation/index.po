"Websites that use location-aware browsing will ask where you are in order to "
"bring you more relevant information, or to save you time while searching. "
"Let’s say you’re looking for a pizza restaurant in your area. A website will "
"be able to ask you to share your location so that simply searching for "
"“pizza” will bring you the answers you need... no further information or "
"extra typing required."

"This service is totally optional – Firefox doesn’t share your location "
