# the Pofake line above calls a modified version of my "personal" 
# Po file editor program, which I've hacked for the moment to 
# simply copy msgid's to msgstr's when the latter are missing--
# this is because the dtd's etc. will be unhappy with empty strings
# and we don't get to rely on the gettext smarts anymore!
#  should keep this even if I smugly think every string is handled in PO
#  as a kind of fail-safe!
